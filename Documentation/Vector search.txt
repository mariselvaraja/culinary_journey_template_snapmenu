Semantic Search Implementation Documentation
Overview
A semantic search system using vector embeddings to find menu items based on meaning rather than just keywords. The system uses the MiniLM-L6-v2 model for generating embeddings and cosine similarity for matching.

Architecture
Components:

transformers.worker.js: Web Worker for running the ML model
embeddingsService.js: Service for managing embeddings generation
searchService.js: Core search functionality
Pre-computed embeddings stored in embeddings.json
Key Features:

Asynchronous embedding generation using Web Workers
Pre-computed embeddings for performance
Cosine similarity matching
Category-based result grouping
State management for search initialization
Technical Details:

Model: Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Vector size: 384 dimensions
Similarity threshold: 0.5
Top results limit: 10
Build Configuration:

Special Vite configuration for Web Worker bundling
